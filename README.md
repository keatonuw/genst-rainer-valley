## **Population Health Topics**
### _Transportation:_

### _Education:_

Education is a public health barrier for Rainier Valley. Education typically leads to better jobs, more money and many other benefits, including better health insurance, which leads to better access to quality health care.

On analysing the education centers in Rainier Valley, it can be noticed that there is an abundance of basic public elementary and middle schools however, there are only about 2 or 3 reputed high schools and universities.
This lack of higher education has consequences as notable from a 2016 demographic that mentions :-

Median household income in Rainier Valley = $70,098<br>
Median household income in Seattle = $83,476


### _Urban Planning:_

Urban Planing is a public health asset for Rainer Valley. The Seattle government has made a great plan for land use and urban design. The plan includes several categories like business and public realm plan. I feel like the public realm plan is going to make incredible changes in the urban areas. It’s going to be used in improving the physical connections between the smaller centers of activity which include health care centers, schools and ethnic markets. Also, they’re planning to build some of the urban areas to a public art area which could become places for tourists and place for cultural heritage.
### _Homelessness:_

Homelessness is a public health barrier for Rainer Valley. There is one city-sponsored encampment, called Othello, on the western border of the neighborhood. Othello, and the other permitted villages across the city, aim to provide "safer living spaces for people who are unsheltered and living in tents, doorways and vehicles across our city," which is an admirable goal (“City-Permitted Villages”). However, that’s the only city-backed resource available to aid those experiencing homelessness. The resources are severely lacking, especially since other neighborhoods have many more resources, including food banks and larger shelters. Furthermore, without a proper "population health framework" that addresses the causes of homelessness, "rapid re-housing… can be overwhelmed by inflows of newly homeless people," therefore, Rainer Valley's public health would benefit from more available and developed resources (Nicholas).
