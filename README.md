Homelessness is a public health barrier for Rainer Valley. There is one city-sponsored encampment, called Othello, on the western border of the neighborhood. Othello, and the other permitted villages across the city, aim to provide "safer living spaces for people who are unsheltered and living in tents, doorways and vehicles across our city," which is an admirable goal (“City-Permitted Villages”). However, that’s the only city-backed resource available to aid those experiencing homelessness. The resources are severely lacking, especially since other neighborhoods have many more resources, including food banks and larger shelters. Furthermore, without a proper "population health framework" that addresses the causes of homelessness, "rapid re-housing… can be overwhelmed by inflows of newly homeless people," therefore, Rainer Valley's public health would benefit from more available and developed resources (Nicholas).
